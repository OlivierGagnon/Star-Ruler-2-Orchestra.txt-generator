# Star-Ruler-2-Orchestra.txt-generator
Star Ruler 2 Orchestra.txt generator

You can use this to generate an orchestra.txt file, which is a playlist for Star Ruler 2

Game was recently open sourced without music, so here's a way to add your own!

Source of the game is here: https://github.com/BlindMindStudios/StarRuler2-Source

I spent some time to analyze the orchestra.txt and do some tests, and the way it's generated now is the most efficient way to make it.
There used to be more stuff, but it's not implemented or doesn't work, so what actually works is what this program generates
